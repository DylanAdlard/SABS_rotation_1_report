# SABS_rotation_1_report

This repository presents and analyses the results from the structure-based machine learning models developed during my rotation with Philip Fowler as a student of the SABS DTC.

The report exists in Report.ipynb.

All requirements are listed in requirements.txt.

Stride, however, has to be installed manually: http://webclu.bio.wzw.tum.de/stride/install.html

The SearchModels() class can be found in ModelsSearch/SearchModels.py.

The sbmlcore software repository can be accessed at https://github.com/fowler-lab/sbmlcore.

The repository is accessible on MyBinder, however Stride will not run - therefore, the notebook will only run if Stride secondary structure is removed as a feature.
